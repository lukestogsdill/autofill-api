About Co-Intelligence Labs
We're a well-funded AI startup in stealth mode building intelligent platforms that transform healthcare decision-making. Our mission is to make complex healthcare navigation effortless through AI-powered recommendations and conversational interfaces that are secure, scalable, and accessible to everyone.

About the Role
As a Junior Fullstack Engineer, you'll contribute to our next-generation healthcare recommendation platform while learning from experienced engineers. You'll work across the technology stack, from frontend interfaces to backend services, while gaining exposure to cutting-edge AI integrations. This is an excellent opportunity to grow your skills in a modern tech environment.
You'll work with technologies like Next.js, React Native, NestJS, and AI services while collaborating closely with senior engineers, designers, and product teams. We'll provide mentorship and guidance as you contribute to features that help users navigate healthcare decisions through AI-powered conversations.
Location: Austin, TX (relocation assistance provided)

In this role, you will:
• Contribute to fullstack development across web (Next.js/React + Tailwind), mobile (React Native/Expo), and backend (NestJS) with guidance from senior engineers
• Learn AI integration by working on conversational user experiences and helping implement AI features across our platform
• Build basic data components
• Support deployment processes on AWS and learn about CI/CD pipelines, environment management, and production systems
• Develop API endpoints for features like messaging and user management while learning best practices for error handling and testing
• Collaborate with the team to understand product requirements, participate in code reviews, and contribute to technical discussions
• Learn through real projects by working on user-facing features while receiving feedback and guidance on code quality and architecture
You might thrive in this role if you:
• Have foundational programming skills with experience in JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and basic backend development (internships, projects, or coursework count!)
• Are eager to learn AI technologies and interested in understanding how AI can solve real-world problems
• Know some of our tech stack - familiarity with React, Node.js, databases, or similar technologies (we'll teach you the specifics)
• Have built projects during school, internships, or personal time - web apps, mobile apps, or full-stack projects demonstrate your interest in development
• Are curious and collaborative - you ask questions, seek feedback, and enjoy working with others to solve problems
• Care about making an impact in healthcare and want to build technology that helps people make better decisions
• Communicate well and can explain your code and thought process to teammates, even when you're still learning
• Are excited about growth - you want to develop your skills rapidly in a mentorship-rich environment
• Enjoy playing with new technologies - we’re all pushing the envelope with how we develop products and we expect you to do the same
